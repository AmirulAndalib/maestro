A20 Line
********

The A20 line represents the 21st bit on the memory line which has to be enabled in order to allow access to memory over 1 MB. This line is disabled by default for backward compatibility with i286.



Checking if enabled
===================

Sometimes, the BIOS enables the A20 line itself, so it's better to check if it's already enabled before actually doing it.

The kernel can check if the line is enabled by writing two different values on the an even and odd megabyte value and then checking them. If the two values are not equal, the line is already enabled.
For example, we can use addresses ``0x012345`` and ``0x112345``.



Enabling
========

The line can be enabled by calling the PS2 keyboard controller. The reason for it is because at the time, the keyboard controller (which usually is a derivative of the `8042 <http://www.diakom.ru/el/elfirms/datashts/Smsc/42w11.pdf>`_ chip) had a spare pin, so it was used for this feature.
