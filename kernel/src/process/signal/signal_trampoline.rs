//! A signal trampoline calls a signal handler when a signal occurs, and handling restoring the
//! original context after the handler returns.
//!
//! The trampoline executing in userspace.
//!
//! The trampoline takes as argument:
//! - `handler`: a pointer to the handler function for the signal
//! - `sig`: the signal number
//! - `ctx`: the context to restore after the handler finishes
//!
//! Restoring the original context is done by calling [`crate::syscall::sigreturn::sigreturn`].
