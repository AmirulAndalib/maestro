//! This module implements the PATA interface for hard drives.
//!
//! The PATA interface is an old, deprecated interface that has been replaced by
//! the SATA interface.
//!
//! ATA devices may be detected by the PCI, but if not, it doesn't mean that
//! they are not present. The disk(s) may instead use the standardized IO ports
//! for legacy support.
//!
//! Legacy PATA can support up to two buses, each supporting up to two drives.
//! Each bus has its own set of ports.
//!
//! Before using a drive, the kernel has to:
//! - Reset the ATA controller
//! - Select the drive (with the dedicated command)
//! - Identify it to retrieve information, such as whether the drives support LBA48
//!
//! TODO

// TODO Add support for third and fourth bus
