//! Devices, buses and peripherals implementation.
//!
//! A device file is an interface with a device of the system, which can be
//! internal or external, or even virtual such as a TTY.
//!
//! Since files management requires devices to be initialized in order to access filesystems, the
//! system first needs to initialize devices. However, at that stage, device files cannot be
//! created.
//!
//! Thus, devices are initialized in stages:
//! - **stage 1**: files management is not yet initialized, which means device files are not
//!   created when devices are registered
//! - **stage 2**: files management is initialized, device files can be created. When switching to
//!   that stage, the files of all device that are already registered are created
