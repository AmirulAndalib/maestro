//! OOM killing is a procedure which is invoked when the kernel runs out of
//! memory.
//!
//! The OOM killer terminates one or more processes according to a score computed for
//! each of them.
//!
//! This is an emergency procedure which is not supposed to be used under normal conditions.

	// - shrink page cache
	// - shrink directory entries cache
	// - swap memory to disk
	// - if the kernel is configured for it, prompt the user to select processes to kill
	// - if the kernel is configured for it, kill the process with the highest OOM score (ignore
	//   init process)
	// - else, panic:
	panic!("Out of memory");

/// Executes the given function. On failure due to a lack of memory, the function runs the OOM
/// killer, then tries again.

/// If the OOM killer is unable to free enough memory, the kernel may panic.
