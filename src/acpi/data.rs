//! This module implements a structure which allows to retrieve the ACPI data from physical memory.
//!
//! The issue when retrieving such information is that if the system has too much memory, the ACPI
//! data may be too high in memory to recover directly. The structure implemented in this module
//! uses a temporary virtual memory context to get a copy of the data.
