/// A spinlock is a lock that is used to prevent a specific piece of code from being accessed by
/// more than one thread at a time. It works by storing a value telling whether a thread is already
/// in that piece of code. To avoid race conditions, the implementation uses an atomic exchange
/// instruction to check/lock the structure.
/// If a threads tries to lock the structure while already being locked, the thread shall wait in
/// a loop (spin) until the structure is unlocked.
///
/// Special attention must be aimed toward the usage of this structure since it can easily result
/// in deadlocks if misused.
