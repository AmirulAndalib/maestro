//! This module contains the Mutex and MutexGuard structure.
//!
//! Mutual exclusion is used to protect data from concurrent access.
//! A Mutex allows to ensure that one, and only thread accesses the data stored into it at the same
//! time. Preventing race conditions. They usually work using spinlocks.
//!
//! One particularity with kernel development is that multi-threading is not the only way to get
//! concurrency issues. Another factor to take into account is that fact that an interruption may
//! be triggered at any moment while executing the code unless disabled. For this reason, mutexes
//! in the kernel are equiped with an option allowing to disable interrupts while being locked.
